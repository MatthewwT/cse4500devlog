                        <p class="lead"><br>When starting the game and building ideas around it, 
                            we used some other's for inspiration to guide us in the direction we wanted.  
                            As shown above, some games (like <i>I commissioned some bees 14</i>) we took 
                            inspiration from the artwork while others (like <i>United Heist</i>) we took 
                            inspiration from the level design and gameplay mechanics. Below you can see our 
                            first prototype of the art style we were aiming to achieve along with the 2D puzzle
                            theme of our level design.</p>
                            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1068370488520343622/1070519979201548298/gameconceptrough1.png" width=800px; height=450px alt="#">
                            
                        <p class="lead" style="padding-top: 100px">Once the team got assembled and everyone got their roles,
                            we decided which part of the video game we would like to work on.  This included scene transitions, 
                            character movement, and character interactions to start with.  Once these simple duties were taken care of,
                            we combined all of our work into one project on github and debugged any code that was not functioning correctly.
                            All of this was needed in order to begin our tutorial level which you can see below.</p>
                            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1068370488520343622/1076348602005332008/abstractgameconceptoutside1.png" width=800px; height=450px alt="#">


                            <!-- <p class="lead" style="padding-top: 100px">After some more team discussion and brainstorming ideas,
                            we landed on some puzzle's we each would like to work on along with the theme of the video game.  
                            Using the puzzles as a guide, we each studied tutorials which closely followed our own puzzle design
                            and implemented it on unity on our own.  After some tinkering and debugging, we will push the result
                            of our tutorials onto the main branch of our github in order to combine them together and debug further.</p> -->

                        <h3><br>Movement</h3>
                        <p class="lead">For our 2D puzzle game, our character's movements were very simple. We implemented movement for moving left and right, and also for jumping. </p>
                        <p class="lead">Currently the movement code allows the character to stick to walls, but this might be removed as we currently don't have a use for it.  
                            The movement was first designed by making a simple square box the character allowing it to jump and move on the three different platforms.</p>
                            <p class="lead">In the future we will transfer this movement to the actual character sprite and allow for some sprite animations when the character walks/runs/jumps. 
                            </p>

                            <h3><br>Scene Transition</h3>
                        <p class="lead">For the 2D puzzle game that we are in the process of making, we added a scene transition. This is a 2D box collider that when a player tagged object interacts with it, will transition it to the next scene.</p>

                            <p class="lead">How this works is by first having a player object, after giving it the movement we talked about in a previous dev log. You can add a “tag” onto the object, that tag being “player”. Afterwards, you make a 2D box collider with a trigger. This makes it so whenever a “player” tag object interacts with the collider, they are then moved to that next scene.</p>
                            
                            <p class="lead">To access what scene to load is by accessing the Scene Manager in unity, as each scene increases by 1. It makes it so when the player goes through the door, the trigger just has to increment the scene it's currently in by one.</p>
                            
                            <p class="lead">The current issue at the moment is having the player spawn at a predetermined vector without having to add the player where you’d want them to be at. It adds a bit more work on where you want the player to spawn and makes it impractical when it comes to moving the player through transition.</p>
                            
                            <p class="lead">This leads to another issue of being unable to make a transition to a previous scene, as we do not have the vectors to move the player model to spawn exactly where you want them to. This then makes them spawn where you have them by default which can make it quite awkward.  </p>
                            
                            

                            <h3><br>Interactions</h3>
                            <p class="lead">Interactables dealt with how the character will be able to handle certain items or dialogue with NPC's.  
                                </p>
